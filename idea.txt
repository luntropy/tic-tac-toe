1. We have pseudo code for the algorithm
    1.1. Check how optimize it with alpha-beta pruning
    1.2. Check what is needed for the implementation of the algorithm
2. Create the board and visualize it

When the game is won:
  0 1 2
0 x x x
1 - - -
2 - - -

  0 1 2
0 x - -
1 x - -
2 x - -

  0 1 2
0 x - -
1 - x -
2 - - x

Keep track of each row, column and diagonal of how many x-s or o-s are placed
After end of each turn we will know if the player won

How to calculate the diagonals:
int main_diag_index(int row_index, int col_index) {
    return (N - 1) + (col_index - row_index);
}
N = 3

int secondary_diag_index(int row_index, int col_index) {
    return col_index + row_index;
}

r[row] = count at given row
d1[index] = count at main diagonal
d2[index] = count at secondary diagonal
